A web To Do List you can use on the go!

Link to project: https://gaburielu.github.io/Project-Todo-List/

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack and libraries of choices

Optimizations & Improvement to be made
1. Separate the code base on specification(DOM Display Rendering, Saving to Local Storage and Todo object)
2. Need to include a filter method to group project based on dates.
3. Need a separate list for deleted todo's.
4. Need to improve UI/UX for better visibility and usability.

Lessons Learned:
Refactor the code 2 times due to bad planning and failure to read the project requirement properly.
First time tried to make a more modular project by using separate js files(although it is still a spaghetti code) and ES6 classes. Dipping my feet in module-bundler(Webpack) and libraries (date-fns). Reduced reliance on AI(ChatCGP) and more on personal research.
